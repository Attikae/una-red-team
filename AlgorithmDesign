for each course
  if sections of the course are available
    for each faculty


      if faculty has available hours && not already teaching course
            if the faculty has prefs for course ??? Maybe here is where we do a check for prefs that apply in recursion cases
              Get valid prefs
              if there are valid prefs
                if number of valid prefs > 1 && sections > 1
                  choose min of #prefs and #sections
                  go check lower priority faculty with relevant prefs
                else
                  schedule section of course for them
            end if
      end if



    end for each faculty
  end if
end for each course



Get valid prefs
  for each pref (pref is a time period)
    Get available time in the pref's range
    if there are times available for the pref
      pref is valid
  end for                   


  Get available times must take into account conflict times, other courses that have been scheduled, and other same level courses that are scheduled at the same time that are not prereqs for a course
